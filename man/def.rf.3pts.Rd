\title{Three-point analysis of genetic markers}
\description{
  This function is defunct and kept only for historical reasons.
  Performs the three-point analysis proposed by \cite{Wu et al. (2002)}
  for a triplet of markers in a given order.
}
\usage{
def.rf.3pts(w, mrk1name = NULL, mrk2name = NULL, mrk3name = NULL, LOD =
5, max.rf = 0.35, max.nolink = 0.55)
}
\arguments{
  \item{w}{an object of class \code{outcross}.}
  \item{mrk1name}{a character string indicating the name of the first
    marker, corresponding to any marker in the input file stored in
    object \code{w}.}
  \item{mrk2name}{a character string indicating the name of the second
    marker.}
  \item{mrk3name}{a character string indicating the name of the third
    marker.}
  \item{LOD}{minimum LOD Score to declare linkage (defaults to
    \code{5}).}
  \item{max.rf}{maximum recombination fraction between \emph{adjacent}
    markers to declare linkage (defaults to \code{0.35}).}
  \item{max.nolink}{maximum recombination fraction between markers on
    the \emph{edge} of the triplet to declare linkage (defaults to
    \code{0.55}).}
}
\details{
  The three markers are analyzed in the order they are given as input,
  i.e., \code{mrk1name - mrk2name - mrk3name}.
}
\value{
  An object of class \code{rf.3pts}, which is a list containing the
  following components:
  \item{LOD}{minimum LOD Score to declare linkage.}
  \item{max.rf}{maximum recombination fraction between \emph{adjacent}
    markers to declare linkage.}
  \item{max.nolink}{maximum recombination fraction between markers on
    the \emph{edge} of the triplet to declare linkage.}
  \item{marnames}{names of the three markers.}
  \item{recomb}{a vector with the three-point estimates of recombination
    fraction between markers \code{mrk1name - mrk2name} and
    \code{mrk2name - mrk3name}, under the most probable assignment.}
  \item{phase}{a character string indicating the most probable
    assignment (linkage phases) for the three markers.}
  \item{analysis}{complete results of the three-point analysis for the
    triplet of markers.}
  \item{goodness}{a vector with character strings indicating the
    \dQuote{goodness} of each assignment, i.e., if the LOD Score and the
    estimates of recombination fraction are consistent with the criteria
    defined. Possible values are: \code{"****"} if the test is
    significant, the estimates are below the thresholds and the order
    seems to be right; \code{"*"} if the test is significant, but
    some estimates are above the thresholds and/or the order seems to be
    wrong; \code{"-"} if the test is not significant or all
    estimates are above the thresholds.}
  \item{flag}{a number indicating if there is more than one equally
    probable assignment for the triplet of markers. Possible values are:
    \code{1} if positive, \code{0} if negative and \code{NA} if linkage
    is not significant.}
