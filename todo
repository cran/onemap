TODO list
- est.rf.3pts as DEFUNCT

- initial markers for compare (D1, D2 & C). Check also missing data and distribution along the linkage group
- check information content between markers before two-point analyses - try should allow more than one marker at a time
- preliminary function
- automator function
- use points for graphical function (fixed color scale; distance proportional to map)
